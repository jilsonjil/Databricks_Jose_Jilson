Report on IoT Device Dataset Streaming
The IoT dataset is read from /databricks-datasets/iot-stream/. 
The schema was referenced from the README file, and an initial static read was performed to understand its structure. 
The dataset contains IoT device activity logs, which likely include attributes such as user_id, device_id, timestamp, and activity metrics.
The dataset could be grouped by user_id and aggregated to count total steps.
If calorie data is present, it can be summed per user over a time window.
Streaming data allows analyzing activity trends across timestamps.
