Overview
SparkLab provides an interactive environment to explore, experiment, and learn Apache Spark. It can be used to run Spark jobs, perform data transformations, and apply machine learning algorithms using Apache Spark's APIs (e.g., pyspark, spark.ml, etc.).

A typical SparkLab setup can consist of:

Interactive Notebooks – Jupyter, Databricks notebooks, or other notebook-based tools for experimenting with Spark.

Batch Processing Jobs – Python, Scala, or Java code to perform Spark-based data transformations and analyses.

Streaming Jobs – Real-time Spark jobs that process streaming data.

Machine Learning – Spark MLlib experiments that showcase classification, regression, clustering, and more.
